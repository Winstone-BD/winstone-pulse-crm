# Roadmap

## Active

0. **Review-only Service Bill Alert** — Implemented and verified locally: `/service-bill-alert` and authenticated `/service-bill-unlock`, server-only PIN and approver-email gates, persistent throttling/audit, safe Hostinger test send, and no payment execution or financial approval. Not published.
0. **Winstone ecosystem integration completion audit** — Completed credential-independent hardening: public-route flood brakes, provider payload replay guard, transactional booking→OS outbox, booking audit events, private MCP tool isolation, booking RLS regression, booked-value wording, and trigger-function hardening. Outbound OS dispatch remains blocked on a real OS endpoint contract; external providers remain configuration-gated.
   - Hostinger service-bill sender: verify `info@winstonebd.com`; current endpoint test is BLOCKED because saved `NOTIFY_EMAIL_ENDPOINT` is not a valid URL.
   - Phone OTP: custom Bangladesh SMS hook, 6 digits, 300 seconds, auto-confirm off; CONFIGURATION REQUIRED until a real gateway and credentials exist.
   - Connector-backed services: connect only with real workspace authorization; otherwise report CONFIGURATION REQUIRED without blocking CRM/OS core.
1. **Phone-friendly CRM tables** — Completed: high-use lead, support, performance, accountability and synced-call tables now become compact phone cards while retaining full laptop tables; remaining wide tables use contained touch scrolling.
2. **Google Drive reconnection** — Completed: linked a fresh Google Drive account in the new workspace; verified folder reads and a write/delete probe in the CRM archive (probe file removed).
3. **Search results show report description** — Completed: Lead 360 search rows and its call timeline render the shared expandable report card (manual description + structured fields), and exports carry the last report date/description.
4. **Mobile check of lead details + Personal Notes** — Completed on a 390px phone: Overview, Personal Notes, reports and timeline all present; notes composer and full-report expansion work. Fixed a clipped sheet header (24px cut off the right edge) in LeadDossier, AgentDossier, HqDrillSheet and NavSidebar, enlarged the sheet close target, and raised the brief/note/expand buttons to touch size.
5. **LeadHub Nexus consolidation** — Completed: Coordinator entry removed; dedicated PIN-only canonical database, import, quality, oldest-first quantity assignment and safe `/dispatch` redirect added.
6. **Correct agent performance analysis** — Use actual call duration/connected status/outcomes from `call_reports`/`calls`/`recordings`, not report submission counts. Identify who is actually wasting leads (short/no-answer/fake reports) vs genuinely working them.
7. **Google Sheets reconnection** — Pending; user paused to fix report logic first.
8. **Follow-up priority** — Completed: Hot/Warm/Cold-derived priority and overdue/due/category ordering across server reminders and web views.
9. **System update report** — Completed: factual IT update history from persisted app release notes.
10. **IT Council notice board** — Completed: IT publishing to all/role/accounts, recipient inbox, read state, replies, web realtime, push and Android notification feed.

## Backlog

3. Revisit Google Sheets connection after report is accepted.

## 2026-09-30 request (pending answers)

- [ ] APK nearby-lead cards (blocked: sign-in cannot be removed — security)
- [x] Locked V2 scoring (6 questions, auto category/priority, no manual Hot/Warm/Cold) — web/server/Android
- [x] 9:05 daily briefing acknowledgement gate (server-side, web + Android popup)
- [x] Android foreground-only nearby-lead sorting from saved addresses (on-device geocoding; GPS never uploaded)

## 2026-10-02 — Winstone Sales Success build (in progress)

- [x] Reconnect Google Drive in new workspace (linked; gateway-backed)
- [ ] Reconnect Google Search Console — BLOCKED: no workspace connection exists; user must create it in Connectors settings, then agent links it
- [x] Sales Success operating loop: Sales Copilot (FACT/INTERPRETATION/RECOMMENDATION, bn/bnlish/en, one next question) in sales-intel.server.ts + rules; Property Match from verified project_property facts with honest empty state; Objection Library (agent section + trust/ready_property codes); HQ overview daily market brief + property/project updates; NRB/expat news category + query; 288/288 tests, typecheck clean, build OK. Not published; AI answers and property match not exercised against live facts (market_facts empty).

- Ingest leads: non-device inbound records land unassigned (no round-robin, payload agent_id ignored); OS receiver rate-limited 120/min/IP — verified 2026-10-03, 301/301 tests.
- Evaluation audit: every V2 report submit appends immutable lead_events "evaluation_recorded" (rule version, raw answers, score, category, priority, report/call/agent ids, time) — verified 2026-10-03, 302/302 tests, build OK.
- Locked KPI rule module (src/lib/daily-kpi.ts): 50/50 capped, locked tie-break chain, 17:30 snapshot / 18:00 final phases — tested 305/305. OPEN: wire into Top 3 board + immutable 18:00 snapshot table (needs migration approval).
- Unified bridge lead_ingested on /api/public/os/events (Bearer or HMAC, 409 duplicate_ignored, 422 validation, unassigned canonical intake) — docs/crm1-receiver.md.

- [ ] Phone OTP login (6-digit, 300s, BulkSMSBD via SMS hook, staff+role check after OTP) — blocked: BulkSMSBD API key/sender ID, approval
- [x] Charts dashboard on HQ overview + agent desk (real snapshot data)
- [x] Date-range filters on charts dashboard (আজ/৭/১৪/৩০ দিন/সব সময়/কাস্টম from-to, Dhaka dates) — typecheck clean, build OK, phone-verified on agent desk; not yet published
- [x] Review-only service-bill alert and secure human-review workflow — `/service-bill-alert` plus admin/RBAC + server-PIN `/service-bill-unlock`, immutable attempt audit, database-backed throttling, safe JSON preview, and Hostinger test-send guard. Migration 0077 applied; 327/327 tests, typecheck/build, and desktop/mobile public/signed-out checks passed. Not published; live Hostinger delivery still awaits valid relay configuration.
- [ ] Hostinger-only service-bill delivery — configure/verify the HTTPS relay, `info@winstonebd.com`, approver recipient and test delivery, then publish; sign-in and reset emails remain on the managed email system
